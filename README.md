YouTube Trending Videos Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes YouTube trending video data to identify popular genres (categories), viewer sentiment trends, and regional differences in content popularity. The analysis is visualized in a Tableau dashboard (elevatelabs1.twb) and summarized in a LaTeX report (YouTube_Trending_Analysis.tex) using data storytelling. The dataset, YouTube_Trending_Cleaned.csv, includes fields such as video_id, title, channel_title, publish_time, views, likes, dislikes, comment_count, and category_name.
Project Structure

Dataset: YouTube_Trending_Cleaned.csv
Contains YouTube trending video data with fields: video_id, title, channel_title, publish_time, views, likes, dislikes, comment_count, category_name.
Used as the data source for the Tableau workbook.


Tableau Workbook: elevatelabs1.twb
Includes a dashboard with three visualizations:
Top Genres by Views: Horizontal bar chart of the top 5 categories by total views.
Sentiment by Category: Stacked bar chart showing the average likes-to-dislikes ratio per category.
Region-wise Comparison: Grouped bar chart comparing views across categories for inferred regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia).




Report: YouTube_Trending_Analysis.tex
A LaTeX document summarizing the analysis with sections on introduction, methodology, findings, recommendations, and conclusion.
Compile with PDFLaTeX to generate a PDF report.



Prerequisites

Tableau: Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public (version compatible with the workbook, e.g., Tableau 2023.1 or later) to view and interact with elevatelabs1.twb.
LaTeX Environment: A LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) with latexmk and packages geometry, amsmath, booktabs, parskip, enumitem, inputenc, fontenc, lmodern, and noto to compile YouTube_Trending_Analysis.tex.
Dataset: Ensure YouTube_Trending_Cleaned.csv is accessible and placed in the same directory as the Tableau workbook or linked appropriately.

Setup Instructions

Clone or Download the Repository:git clone <repository-url>
cd youtube-trending-analysis


Tableau Dashboard:
Open elevatelabs1.twb in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
Ensure YouTube_Trending_Cleaned.csv is in the same directory or update the data source path in Tableau if needed.
Explore the dashboard to view visualizations for genres, sentiment, and regional comparisons.


Compile the LaTeX Report:
Ensure a LaTeX distribution is installed (e.g., TeX Live).
Navigate to the directory containing YouTube_Trending_Analysis.tex.
Run:latexmk -pdf YouTube_Trending_Analysis.tex


This generates YouTube_Trending_Analysis.pdf in the same directory.


Verify Dataset:
Confirm YouTube_Trending_Cleaned.csv contains the required fields and is formatted correctly (UTF-8 encoding, as specified in the workbook).
If regions are not explicitly included, the region-wise comparison assumes regions are inferred from channel_title or external metadata.



Usage

Dashboard Exploration:
Use the Tableau dashboard to filter by categories, view sentiment trends, or compare regional performance.
Interact with the visualizations to drill down into specific categories or regions.


Report Review:
Open YouTube_Trending_Analysis.pdf to read the data storytelling summary, including insights on popular genres (e.g., Music, Entertainment), sentiment trends (based on likes-to-dislikes ratio), and regional differences.
Use the report for presentations or strategic planning.



Assumptions and Notes

Sentiment Calculation: Sentiment is approximated using the likes-to-dislikes ratio (likes / (likes + dislikes)). Adjust in Tableau if a different metric is preferred.
Region Data: The dataset lacks an explicit region field. The region-wise comparison assumes regions are inferred (e.g., from channel_title). Update the workbook with actual region data if available.
Dependencies: Ensure all LaTeX packages listed in the report are installed. The noto font is used for compatibility with non-Latin characters, though not required for this dataset.

Results

Popular Genres: Music, Entertainment, and Gaming are the top categories by views.
Sentiment Trends: Comedy and Music show the highest positive sentiment (likes-to-dislikes ratio > 0.9).
Regional Insights: Music and Entertainment are universally popular, with Gaming stronger in Asia (assumed) and Comedy stronger in Europe.
